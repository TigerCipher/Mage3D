# Mage3DX
Mage3DX is a directX version of my main Mage3D OpenGL game engine. Currently this is a separate project as I teach myself DirectX and did not feel like making a separate git repo. As I am using this "sub project" to learn DirectX, I also plan to experiment with UI and potentially make this into an engine with an actual UI editor

#### Notice:
I personally prefer Clion over Visual Studio, hence this being a CMake project. Should I decide to follow through and polish/release a directx version of my engine, it will be intended to be compiled and built via Visual Studio (I find working with VS compiler options in CMake to be a bit wonky). If I do end up making this a full blown editor, I may end up making this version closed source.
